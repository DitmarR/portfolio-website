<h5>G’day, my name is Ditmar, and I’m a 16 year old currently living in the 
     northen side of the Netherlands. <br>
     I’ve always been quite interested in coding since I was little. <br>
     When I was younger, I watched my dad, program for his work,<br> just for fun because,
     it was really fascinating and it really got my attention. <br>
     I’ve created some websites, back in highschool, but they weren’t that
     interesting and it was nothing too, fancy. <br>
     I’m currently studying programming, and finding a lot of joy doing so. <br>
     
     And I’m quite excited to go forward and learn more about<br> the wondrous world
     of programming!</h5>

<h4>
My hobbies are mostly calling with my mates, playing Fortnite
 on the competitive side, and competing against other high tier players.
Besides that I love Legos and got a full collection of Ninjago. 
And last, I love Australia, and the wildlife there, and I love the way they speak,
 the way they, pronounce certian types of words, and I don't really sound like a native here,
I've got a more, UK/Australian accent.
